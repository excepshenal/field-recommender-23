    "We split the full dataset into a `train` and `test` dataset to evaluate performance of the algorithm against a held-out set not seen during training. Because SAR (typo?) generates recommendations based on user preferences, all users that are in the test set must also exist in the training set. For this case, we can use the provided `python_stratified_split` function which holds out a percentage (in this case 25%) of items from each user, but ensures all users are in both `train` and `test` datasets. Other options are available in the `dataset.python_splitters` module which provide more control over how the split occurs."
